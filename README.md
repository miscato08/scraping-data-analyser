# scraping-data-analyser
In this Project, I tried to go to IMDB, scraping the Data from the Top films, putting that into a CSV file and than train a machine learning model, to view how well it performs. Sadly the project wasn't successful at all (could be because my knowledge wasn't that well when I created this project.


### App.py
* Main script, where we try to get the Data from the IMDB website. Because the project isn't 100%, we don't have a pipeline between front and backend to interact with the script

### Data_vs2 file
* Our CSV file, where we stored our Data

### Frontend Folder
* Should be our Frontend, but sadly we haven't finished our project, so it's just with an HTML file

### Notebooks
1. Model, where we create our Model
2. Scraping, where we scrape/process our data and store it into the CSV file
3. Visualize, where we try perform some Data Science
